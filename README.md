## File Naming Conventions

Consistent and clear file naming is essential for maintaining an organized and easily navigable e-Library. Follow these guidelines to ensure that files are named appropriately within the IIT Patna Cloud Computing Batch 2 M.Tech e-Library repository:

## 1. Descriptive Names

Choose file names that provide a clear indication of the content's subject, purpose, and relevance. Avoid vague or generic names that may lead to confusion.

**Good Examples:**
- `CC-Batch2-Lecture1-Introduction.pdf`
- `Database-Systems-Assignment.docx`

**Bad Examples:**
- `File1.pdf`
- `ImportantDocumentFromMathsLecture.docx`

## 2. Use Hyphens or Underscores

Use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to separate words in the file name. This enhances readability and ensures that spaces are properly handled in web links and commands.

**Examples:**
- `Cloud-Computing-Concepts.pptx`
- `Datawarehouse_Fundamentals.pdf`

## 3. Consistent Formatting

Maintain consistent formatting throughout the file names to make them visually appealing and easy to scan.

**Examples:**
- `Topic-Subtopic-Description.pdf`
- `Assignment2-DataWarehouse-Security.docx`

## 4. Abbreviations and Capitalization

Use standard abbreviations if they are well-known and understood by the intended audience. For acronyms, use all capital letters.

**Examples:**
- `VM-Deployment-Guide.pdf`
- `ACID-Overview.docx`

## 5. Version Control (Optional)

If multiple versions of a file exist, consider adding version numbers or dates to the file name to differentiate them.

**Examples:**
- `DataWarehouse-Analytics-v2.pptx`
- `Load-Balancing-2023-08-20.pdf`

## 6. Avoid Special Characters

Avoid using special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc., as they might lead to compatibility issues in different systems.

## 7. File Extensions

Use appropriate file extensions to indicate the file format. For instance, use `.pdf` for PDF documents, `.pptx` for PowerPoint presentations, `.docx` for Word documents, and so on.

## 8. Folder Structure

Ensure that the file is placed within the correct directory that corresponds to the relevant subject or category.

## 9. Keep It Short and Meaningful

Strive for a balance between a concise file name and one that conveys the essential information about the content.

By adhering to these file naming conventions, we can maintain an organized and user-friendly e-Library that benefits all students in the IIT Patna Cloud Computing Batch 2 M.Tech program.
